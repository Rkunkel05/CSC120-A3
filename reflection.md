Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I worked with Huda and Lucy on this assignment, and also consulted https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial
as well as https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/overview-summary.html.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to office hours on Tuesday.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I am finding Java to be very similar to Python with it's logic and problem-solving. However, this problem solving is a little more complicated - especially with doing basic things like printing. It was a little clunky and awkward to figure out at first, but once I got over the initial curve of syntax and formatting, it became much easier. However, I don't know if it was just this assignment, but I am finding it a little tricky to keep track of all the curly brackets and what parts of code they connect back to. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Python and Java are two relatively different languages. They use different syntax, have different capabilities, and more. However, I found the process of problem solving and the steps associated with it to still be the same. No matter what language you are working in, you always start off with breaking down the problem, writing out a rough idea of how you might solve it, and then start building the bones and more. In addition to this, I feel like the biggest barrier to starting a new language is the initial curve with formatting and syntax. After you get familiar with that, it becomes much easier to navigate. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
In my code, I feel like I was able to accomplish most takes, but not in the most efficient manner. Much of my code looks clunky and there are definitely cleaner ways to write out my thoughts. This lack of organization sometimes made it difficult for me to keep track of variable names, curly brackets, and if my code was included in a loop or not. I feel that spending more time writing out my ideas might have helped with this, and I would suggest someone taking this course in the future to write out their ideas first before touching any code! Especially if you don't know where to start with code, it gets your brain thinking and can help launch you into the coding mindset. Also, it gives a good checklist of things to complete. On a similar note, I would also suggest not to be afraid of messing around and writing out rough ideas of code - even if the syntax isn't right and VSCode yells at you for it.
