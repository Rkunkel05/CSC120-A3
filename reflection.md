- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
* Huda
* Consulted https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial
* Consulted https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/overview-summary.html
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
* Very similar to Python with the logic, but a little more complicated with doing basic things
* A little clunky/awkward to figure out, but once you get over the inital curve of syntax, it becomes
much easier
* I don't know if it was just this assignment, but I'm still finding it a little tricky to work with so many variables that I feel like are always changing names...

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
* Problem solving is the same
* Once you get over the initial hurdle of formatting / syntax, things become a lot easier
* Google is your best friend when it comes to figuring out little intricacies / commands that are unique to each program 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
* The Jav Docs (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/index.html) are sooo useful!!
* Try messing around, even if the syntax isn't right
* Writing out your ideas first really helps to figure out where to start / Gives a checklist
